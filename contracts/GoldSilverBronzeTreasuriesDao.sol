/**
* @title Treasuries DAO.
* @dev I decided to use list indexes as nft type identifiers (treasury kinds).
* @dev Thus, gold, silver, bronze supposed to be as 0, 1, 2.
* @dev
* @dev Why I put in Erc721 approve method?
* @dev Case:
* @dev 1. Withdraw approved by NFT owner in DAO contrac,
* @dev 2. Then the NFT owner transfer his NFT to someone.
* @dev What should we do?
* @dev I believe that in this case withdrawal approve should be deprecated.
* @dev The optimal way is to deligate deprecation to Nft specific, where approve removed on Nft transfered.
* @dev And to approve withdraw you merely need to approve nft for the dao contract below.
* @dev Via this trick we as well ban NFT owner to approve his NFT for transfer to smbdy
* @dev when nft owner particiate in dao withdraw process. On success withdraw contract sets nft approve
* @dev to 0 address.
* @dev PS. to have the ability to set approve NFT owner have to run once approveForAll
* @dev to the dao contract.
